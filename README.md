# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Purpose

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.
 
The Horiseon marketing agency website has been updated to follow accessibility standards so that it is optimized for search enginers and ensures that people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies.
